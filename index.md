Welcome to HSF Spack tutorial! The aim of this tutorial is to cover the basics of using Spack,
a flexible package manager that supports multiple versions, configurations, platforms, and
compilers. The scope of this tutorial is the use of Spack in typical HSF software activities.

At the end of this tutorial, you should be be able to:
* explain how Spack differs from other package managers,
* understand the syntax of Spack's package specifications (specs),
* define and use Spack environments with self-consistent sets of packages,
* install typical HSF software packages on your systems using Spack,
* use upstream Spack installations provided by LCG for dependencies,
* use external Spack package repositories for domain-specific packages.

More detailed information on Spack, aimed at developers and administrators of software systems,
is available at the [Spack Tutorial](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/).
